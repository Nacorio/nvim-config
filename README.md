This is my Neovim config primarily for working with rust.
This config requires Neovim 0.12 (currently the nightly build) because it uses the vim.pack package manager built into Neovim.

the Arduino-Nvim plugin needs to manually installed by cloning the repository to lua/Arduino-Nvim (repo: https://github.com/yuukiflow/Arduino-Nvim.git).

You need to copy the .clang-format file into the project directory of any C projects you want to format.

I will probably add a full list of dependencies someday.
