This is my Neovim config primarily for working with rust.
This config requires Neovim 0.12 (currently the nightly build) because it uses the vim.pack package manager built into Neovim.

the Arduino-Nvim plugin needs to manually installed by cloning the repository to lua/Arduino-Nvim (repo: https://github.com/yuukiflow/Arduino-Nvim.git).

I will probably add a full list of dependencies someday.
